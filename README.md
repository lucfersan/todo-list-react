## About The Project

![Login Pages React](.github/todos.gif)

This is a todo app with react, which has some great functionalities such as authentication, connection to an external api, and more!

**This is the [Api-Repo](https://github.com/lucfersan/api-todo-list-react) I developed for this project.**

It uses react context api to handle some features such as the update modal and authentication credentials.

It was a great experience for me to work with those technologies and learn a little bit of deployment and connection to an external service.
